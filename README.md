### Notes
Everything went really smooth this time! Only hiccup was that I was watching the videos consecutively and so I missed the note on the assignments page about modifying the estimate size of my collection view.

### Notes
While I was installing Pods I ran into an issue with my M1 Mac but was able to resolve it after getting help on the official slack channel. Another challenge I ran into was using github at the end. I had some trouble with stashing local changes but figured it out after watching some youtube videos.
